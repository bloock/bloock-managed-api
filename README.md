# bloock-managed-api

Managed api is a tool to integrate automatically in your system and include some bloock products:

- Integrity âœ…
- Keys
- Authenticity
- Encryption
- Identity
- Availability

See postman doc: https://www.postman.com/bloock/workspace/bloock-api/documentation/16945237-3566feb8-1d4b-45c1-b0a1-f7de0be9348a

## Quickstart

### Requeriments

- Docker Engine(https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
- Makefile toolchain
- Bloock account and API key (https://docs.bloock.com/libraries/authentication/signup)
- Set up a Bloock webhook (https://docs.bloock.com/webhooks/overview)

### Configuration

The service uses viper as a configuration manager, currently supporting environment variables and a YAML configuration file. Only environment variables with the "bloock" key prefix are supported.

##### Variables

- BLOOCK_API_PORT: The main API port; default is 8080.
- BLOOCK_API_HOST: The main API host IP; default is 10.0.5.23.
- BLOOCK_API_KEY: Your Bloock API key.
- BLOOCK_WEBHOOK_URL: Your webhook URL.
- BLOOCK_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY: Your webhook secret key.
- BLOOCK_ENFORCE_TOLERANCE: Decide if you want to set tolerance when verifying the webhook; true or false.
- BLOOCK_DB_CONNECTION_STRING: Your database URL; e.g., mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/mydatabase.

##### Configuration file

The configuration file should be named `config.yaml`. You need to provide the file path in an environment variable called BLOOCK_CONFIG_PATH, for example: `BLOOCK_CONFIG_PATH="app/conf/"` (without the filename).

Sample content of `config.yaml`:

```yaml
APIHost: "0.0.0.0"
APIPort: "8080"
APIKey: ""
WebhookURL: ""
WebhookSecretKey: ""
WebhookEnfaultTolerance: ""
DBConnectionString: "file:bloock?mode=memory&cache=shared&_fk=1"
```

### Database
The service supports three types of relational databases: MemDB (SQLite), MySQL, and Postgres. You only need to provide the database URL in the following format:

````
MySQL: <user>:<pass>@tcp(<host>:<port>)/<database>?parseTime=True
Postgres: postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
MemDB: file:dbname?mode=memory&cache=shared&_fk=1
````

### Start the service

#### Locally
The service uses Docker and Makefile to run. There are three example Docker Compose files provided for each database. To start the service locally, follow these steps:

Execute make cache to install the dependencies.
Execute make mocks to create mock files.

To start the service with MySQL:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-mysql.yaml up
```

To start the service with Postgres:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-postgres.yaml up
```
To start the service with MemDB:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-memdb.yaml up
```
The default Docker Compose file uses MemDB. You can execute the service with `make up` command, which will build the application and start the service in a Docker container.
